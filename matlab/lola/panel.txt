1. Image File Name: 
-------------------
   The input image format is the following:

          The first two lines has the number of columns and number
          of rows, respectively, in ASCII. The rest of the file
          is the row scanned image stored as 8 bit per pixel.

2. Edge File Name Base:
-----------------------
   The base for the output file names. There are two outputs: the edge
map and the list of edge segments. The default name base is the
image_file_name. So the edge map would be in image_file_name.edge and
the segments would be in image_file_name.atts

========================================================================
The following 6 are paramters for edge focusing. 

3. Start Scale: 
--------------
It is the coarsest scale of the edge operator to start the focusing
from.

4. Stop Scale:
-------------
This is a paramter for edge focusing. It is the finest desired scale
in edge focusing. 

     IF YOU GIVE THE SAME VALUE FOR coarse AND fine SCALES THEN IT WILL
     GIVE YOU EDGES AT THAT SCALE. THIS IS THE WAY TO BYPASS THE
     FOCUSSING ALGORITHM.

5. Constant Step Focusing:
-------------------------
This specifies whether to takes uniformly spaced steps in scale space
or to dynamically choose the step size depending on the behaviour of
the edge detector. The default is the latter.

6. Segment Based Focusing:
--------------------------
The option is to focus the segments of the edge chain after contour
segmentation or to focus the whole edge chains themselves. 


7. Focusing Similarity Index:
-----------------------------
This is a similarity parameter (between 0 and 1) denoting the expected
amount of similarity between scales. It is used by the focussing
algorithm to dynamically choose the step size. Typical value is 0.8 -
0.9.  It is no consequense if the focussing algorithm is bypassed or
if we are doing constant step focusing.

8. Focusing Step Size:
----------------------
This specifies the step size to take in scale space when doing
constant step edge focusing.

======================================================================
The following four are contour segmenation paramters:
9. Minimum Segment Length:
--------------------------
The minimum length of the edge chain below which we do not segment.

10. Segmentation Index:
----------------------
This controls the degree of segmentation. If this is high we will have
a large number of segments and if low then we will have a small number
of segments.

11. Minimum Deviation:
----------------------
This is the minimum tolerable deviation of a point from the
approximating curve. It controls the minimum error of our segmentation.

12. THRESHOLD? (1-Yes)
13. THRESHOLD VALUE:
-------------------
These are to interactively threshold the edge segments or chains.
